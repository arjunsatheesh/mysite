    <center><h1>Hot Hatches!</h1></center>
    <p> People have always looked at small hatchbacks as practical urban machines. Not only are they convenient in terms of parking and squeezing in and out of small gaps but are also relatively inexpensive.
I have always felt my office commute to be more interesting in a small and adequately powerful hatchback. You don't need to worry about the size and can easily nip in and out of gaps like a bike, well not exactly like a bike but you get my point. Going up and down multi-level parking is also more enjoyable in a small car. With huge sedans, you cant floor it in such scenarios and most probably would end up having an accident.
The problem with large powerful cars is that it is difficult to extract the maximum performance in a congested country like India. Nothing brings more joy than wringing an engine by the neck and extracting maximum performance from it. The ol high revving v-tec's had a huge fan base because of this.
I remember my Maruti 800 MPFI, the car in which I learnt driving. Lightweight, compact and easy to maintain. The engine only produced 37bhp but it was a hoot to revv the nuts off that motor.
Previously India did not have any hot hatches like International markets and enthusiasts would modify their small hatchbacks for more power output and better handling. But now there are hot hatches such as the Tiago JTP, Figo Sports TDCi, Polo GT TSI/TDI, Abarth Punto and Polo GTI. Among these cars, the Polo GT's have become a huge success and the recently released JTP's also look like they will become a hit due to their pricing and performance.
The Polo GT TSI is the go-to vehicle of enthusiasts for use in an urban environment. The 7-speed DSG-turbo petrol combination is a match made in petrolhead heaven. Do a remap and add stiffer springs for more hooliganry.
Figo Sports is a banger of car. The 1.5L diesel engine is an absolute gem. Add a tuning box or perform a remap and it will spin its wheels all the time. The stiffer suspension and the bigger tyres are also fantastic though it would be good to swap the stock tyres for stickier yoko's or michelins.
Hoping more manufacturers will come out with similar cars that will put a smile on the face of the Indian enthusiast and seeing the JTP's I think India is moving in the right direction. </p>
